üî≠ **Projects Overview**

As a budding enthusiast in the field of deep learning, I am actively engaged in computer vision projects to gain a profound understanding of the intricacies of deep learning and machine learning models. These projects not only allow me to delve deeply into the theoretical aspects but also offer valuable hands-on experience in solving real-world problems. The range of models I've explored thus far includes:

* **Feed Forward Neural Networks**: I have delved into the fundamentals of neural networks, understanding their architecture and training mechanisms to grasp the core concepts of deep learning.

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: I've applied CNNs not only to 2D data but also extended my exploration to 3D data. This has provided me with insights into how these specialized neural networks excel in tasks related to image and spatial data.

* **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: I've worked with SVMs, comprehending their ability to classify data points by finding the optimal hyperplane. This has broadened my understanding of both linear and non-linear classification.

* **Random Forest Classifier**: Exploring ensemble methods, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, has given me insights into leveraging the power of multiple decision trees for improved model performance and robustness.
  
* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Venturing into recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs, has enabled me to address sequential data and grasp the temporal dependencies inherent in various applications.

* **XGBoosting Algorithm**: I've applied the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful gradient boosting technique, to enhance predictive accuracy and handle complex relationships within the data.

Engaging in these diverse models has not only deepened my understanding of the theoretical foundations of machine learning but has also equipped me with the practical skills needed to tackle real-world challenges in computer vision. This hands-on experience is crucial in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and its application in solving complex problems.
